Plan for app (name: Gym Buddy?)

To do:
- Fix <RemoveLog />

For the routines thing, I might want to have a boolean-valued column in the table
indicating which movements are currently being used in the routine.
E.g. for push day you might have pull-ups in the DB as a push day movement, but you're not currently using it
So if you're on the LogProgress page


Functionality I want the app to have:

Add movement:
Edit movement:
- For a given movement, edit the details that the DB contains
Remove movement:
- Delete the movement from the DB
- You'd have to be careful to make sure that there isn't any existing data that references that movement

Add routine:
- Data => routine name, routine "days" (i.e. Push, Pull etc), movements pertaining to those "days"
- 

Edit routine:
- edit routine name
- edit the "days" => add days, edit existing day names, delete days
- amend movements associated with each "day"

Remove routine:

Add log:
- Concept is simple - log your workout progress on a given day
- have a dropdown in the sidebar where you choose a "day" you're logging progress for
- Data => date, movement name, weight, sets, reps, space for any notes on how the workout was
- Wouldn't want the log to depend on the movement name in case the movement is deleted from the DB

Edit log:
Remove log:






Pages:
• Home page
• Manage routines page
• Progress page -- using Chart.js etc
• Settings page -- for changing profile details etc

Home page:
• A welcome page that welcomes you back to the app
• Gives you a heads-up for your next workout
• Also might give a tiny visualisation of your progress in the last few weeks
• Remind user to take phone, mask, headphones, water, towel (and also lifting straps depending on the day)
• Maybe implement a button saying "Been to the gym today?", and when you press it it records that on that day you went to the gym. Could also track how many days total user has been to the gym and what their current streak is

Manage routines:
• Choose from list of existing plans (like PPL, bro split, etc)
• Or make your own routine. Choose:
    • The name of the routine
    • Which exercises you'll do on which day
    • How many days a week you'll do it (and perhaps let them specify on which days)
• Also allow user to create their own exercise. There will be a set of pre-available ones with form instructions and link to form videos, but they can add their own movements if they like

Progress Visualisation:
• Visualise progress in weight lifted
• Compare it to data on Weightlifting Strength Standards - https://strengthlevel.com/strength-standards
• Choose time periods, different lifts, overall powerlifting total (squat + bench + deadlift)
• Timeline of gym sessions -- Maybe make it like google calendar schedule view? Or make it like a calendar view, and each day where you went to the gym has a thingy you can press that'll give you a little widget of what you did on that day

Riccardo also suggested maybe implementing a feature where people can check their form
• this could just be a little gif or video showing how to do the movement
• or maybe in the future once I get competent enough at coding it could be some kind of smart camera scanner thing that scans their body

Backend:
• Express

Database:
