Plan for layout of website (name: Gym Buddy?)

Might want to set up API for storing info and stuff

Pages:
• Home page
• Manage routines page
• Progress page -- using Chart.js etc
• Settings page -- for changing profile details etc

Home page:
• A welcome page that welcomes you back to the app
• Gives you a heads-up for your next workout
• Also might give a tiny visualisation of your progress in the last few weeks

Manage routines:
• Choose from list of existing plans (like PPL, bro split, etc)
• Or make your own routine. Choose:
    • The name of the routine
    • Which exercises you'll do on which day
    • How many days a week you'll do it (and perhaps let them specify on which days)
• Also allow user to create their own exercise. There will be a set of pre-available ones with form instructions and link to form videos, but they can add their own movements if they like

Progress Visualisation:
• Visualise progress in weight lifted
• Compare it to data on Weightlifting Strength Standards - https://strengthlevel.com/strength-standards
• Choose time periods, different lifts, overall powerlifting total (squat + bench + deadlift)
• Timeline of gym sessions -- Maybe make it like google calendar schedule view? Or make it like a calendar view, and each day where you went to the gym has a thingy you can press that'll give you a little widget of what you did on that day


What will a routine look like?
JSON object
Fields:
- days (e.g. push day / pull day / chest day)
- how often a week (e.g. a PPL would be every three days i.e. twice a week with a rest day. Bro split might be one cycle a week)
